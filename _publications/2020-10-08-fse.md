collection: publications
permalink: /publication/adv-fse
excerpt: 'Credit scoring systems are critical FinTech applications that concern the analysis of the creditworthiness of a person or organization. While decisions were previously based on human expertise, they are now increasingly relying on data analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we assess the ability of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning to craft attacks on a real-world credit scoring system.'
