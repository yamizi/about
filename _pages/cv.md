 @ LIST, 2023-

Member of the LEAP project: Learning Enabled Autonomous Real-time Operation For Distribution Grids (LEAP)

Abstract:
As a result, the taxonomy of distribution grid is rapidly changing at a global scale. It is envisioned that future distribution grids will become highly granular with control and operation procedures that will be profoundly different than those of today. It is envisioned that the time windows to solve operational problems will be narrowed in future distribution grids. In order to maintain the safety and stability of DERs-driven increasingly variable operation of power systems, operational planning decisions of agents will no longer be sufficient merely on the basis of a day or a few hours in advance: most decisions must be made in situ and moving to real-time (RT) according to the instantaneous operating conditions of the distributed grids. Operational planning will evolve towards optimal control of complex systems in RT, which cannot be addressed by existing approaches.

In order to address these questions, LEAP proposes ground-breaking solutions based on computational intelligence techniques, specifically based on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which are emerging as major enablers to lead the energy transition. Such an intelligent digital framework will be integrated into a wider digital initiative, i.e., into a Nationwide Digital Twin (NWDT) project.
