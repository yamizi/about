# Partnership with [BGL-BNP Parisbas](http://www.bgl.lu).

BGL-BNP Paribas is a leading bank of Luxembourg. We worked together to evaluate the robustness of their ML pipeline,
in particular the themes of *Concept Drift*, *Generalization* and *Adversarial Attacks*


We published together the paper: 
[Search-based adversarial testing and improvement of constrained credit scoring systems](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Search-based-adversarial-testing-and-improvement-of-Ghamizi-Cordy/32e8a4ac3a5609b961cf67b2aa2bec8a548e499c)
