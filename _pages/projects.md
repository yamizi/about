# Industrial Project with [BGL-BNP Parisbas](http://www.bgl.lu).

BGL-BNP Paribas is a leading bank of Luxembourg. We worked together to evaluate the robustness of their ML pipeline,
in particular the themes of *Concept Drift*, *Generalization* and *Adversarial Attacks*


We published together the paper: 
[Search-based adversarial testing and improvement of constrained credit scoring systems](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Search-based-adversarial-testing-and-improvement-of-Ghamizi-Cordy/32e8a4ac3a5609b961cf67b2aa2bec8a548e499c)


# Covid19 Task force

FNR funded projects: 120K€
Together with TruX research Group, we built simulation and policy recommendation tool for Covid19

Our tool uses machine learning techniques to analyse public data and deliver hypothetical projections of how different isolation measures will impact the spread of coronavirus in more than 100 countries around the world. Currently, it is one of the most sophisticated public tools available for modelling the pandemic and we have an update coming very soon that will make it even better. The update will introduce an optimisation function for policy recommendations based on the desired outcome. That means, for example, you could put in “keep total infections under XXX number at all times” and the tool will give you a set of policies and an implementation timeline that is projected to produce the desired result. We hope that our approach will be a powerful tool for public health officials and decision-makers in the coming weeks and months as societies around the globe continue to come out of lockdown.

We published the paper: [Data-driven Simulation and Optimization for Covid-19 Exit Strategies](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14996cc316d471b84124c77ef9ff5922ad97b155).


It was awarded a *Best Paper Award* at KDD 2020
