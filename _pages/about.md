About Me
======
I am a third year PhD student working at SnT â€” the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg.
I am part of the Serval research group, under the supervision of Pr. Yves Le Traon, Pr. Mike Papadakis and Dr. Maxime Cordy.

My research activities lie at the intersection of Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Security. 
My main topic is about the evaluattion and improvement of the robustness of machine learning algorithms.
Part of my work has been done with an Industrial Partner (BGL BNP-Parisbas), and with other colleagues from the Covid19 Luxembourg Task Force.

I tackle real-life problems where reliable and robust machine learning is of utmost importance. My previous work includes credit scoring and fraud detection, steganography and secure communication, pandemic forecasting and mitigation, using evolutionary optimization approaches, multi-task and multi-label learning.
